# Southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence Plankton Sampling Study

## Purpose

* Monitor ocean acidification through measurement of pteropod shell thickness and other characteristics.
* Measure abundances of crab larvae, in particular snow crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*) megalopa larvae, in relation to the thermocline. 
* Provide samples for other projects, such as the monitoring of *Calanus sp.* abundance, upon which Northern Atlantic Right Whales feed. 

## Methods

* Sampling occurs during spring and summer in the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence. 
* The first exploratory study was conducted at the end of August and beginning of September of 2019, offshore from Cheticamp in Western Cape Breton.
* The second and thrid sampling studies were conducted in 2021, from May 6th to 16th and from August 26th to September 14th in the same location as 2019.

* Sampling is performed using 3-meter plankton nets with a 75cm hoop ring diameter. Mesh dimensions were 200 microns in 2019, and May 2021, while a mesh of 335 microns was used in August-Spetmeber, 2021. Star Oddi Depth-temperature probes were used to record watern temperatures, a mechanical flowmeter was used to record current through the opening, a real-time depth probe was used in 2021 and a colorimeter was used to measure colour of the aggregate plankton sample.

* In 2019, vertical plankton were performed through the water column, and some exploratory horizontal tows were also tried.

* A double-closing mechanism was used starting in 2021. Such a mechanism is used to initially open a closed plankton net that is being cast, followed by a messenger weight to close the net once sampling is completed. This reduces the uncertainty as to the volume/distance of the water column being sampled.

## Samples
* Samples were preserved with formaldehyde or ethyl alcohol. 
* Physical Samples are stored in room 135 of Gulf Fisheries Centre, Moncton, Canada.

## Comments
*	No obvious signs of acidification on pteropod shells via SEM photomicrographs.
*	Samples may be mixtures of pteropods and/or heteropods.

## Key questions: 
* Are there higher concentrations of snow crab larval settlement at the intersection of the thermocline (< 10 meters) and appropriate bottom habitat.

## Data

* Set of SEM photos of pteropod shells (2019)
* 2021 â€“ Colorimeter observations, larval abundances (snow crab only).
